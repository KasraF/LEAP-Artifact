You are an expert Python programmer.
You will fill in the missing piece of Python code. Do not change any of the prefix. Do not change any of the suffix.
Do not repeat the prompt, prefix, or suffix in your answer. The prefix, suffix, and completion when put together, must be parsable as valid Python code.

You will receive a [[prefix]] and a [[suffix]] of Python code. You must fill in the middle.
